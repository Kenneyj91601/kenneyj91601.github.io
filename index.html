     <h4>here we go...</h4>

 <h2>I don't really know what five pages means on HTML, so I am just going to talk your ear off about things
     may or may not even matter, so brace yourself.</h2>
  <h3>TURN BACK NOW IF YOU WANT TO LIVE</h3>

<p1>Sooooo... what should I tell about <i>myself</i></p1>
 <br>
 <br>
 <div>Well first off, I am a 21 African American in America pursuing a successful career
      college so that I can be 'successful' in life as they tell every step of the way :)</div>

 <h2>Ill try my best to explain my being to you since this is meant to be some sort of about me project</h2>
 <h2>I am originally from St. Louis, then after about 18 years, I decided to move to Columbia, MO for the chance to win a degree in some form sort of extended knowledge.<br>
   <img src="https://fox2now.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/14/2018/05/st-louis.jpg" width="300" height="auto"><br>At first, I was on the path of a degree in computer science... due developments that have recently come about,<br> that is not the case anymore and I am instead trotting
   down the path of obtaining a very important piece of paper in Information Technology, and hoping that this goes better than last time.</h2>
  <br>
<h2>I would sit here and explain to you everything that I enjoy on my free time, but I just thought putting it in <a href="index2.html">this list</a> would be better.</h2>
<br>
<h2>One thing that might take up a little too much of my time is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">YOUTUBE</a>(do not click this link if you want to be redirected to youtube forever).<br>
    I literally watch any and everything youtube has to offer everyday and it may be becoming a problem at this point...</h2>
<br>
<p>Sorry Im not using paragraphs that often, they just tend to be kind of small and I did not look up how to change it.</p>
<p>But anyways, I have been enjoying my time in this IT class. It has brushed up on a lot of things that I have not seen in a very long time. The time I created code to pick out specific numbers to change to <a href="index3.html">fizz and buzz</a>...</p>
<p>and the time I made that <a href="index4.html">table</a> to tell me what foods I should eat and the calorie intake of each... </p>
<p>or that one time I spent many hours of dedication making a <a href="index5.html">numbered list of numbererd numbers</a>...</p>

 <h2>All this to say:</h2>
